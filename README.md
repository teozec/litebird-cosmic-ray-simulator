# litebird-cosmic-ray-simulator
A variational autoencoder to generate timestreams of the power measured by LiteBIRD bolometers during cosmic ray impacts; trained with data generated by a traditional cosmic ray simulator.
I used three different model: a Gaussian and two Relaxed Bernoulli with different data normalization.
